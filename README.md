# 🧮 Resizable GUI Calculator (Python Tkinter)

A simple, clean, and fully resizable calculator built using Python and Tkinter.
This project demonstrates GUI design fundamentals, event handling, and responsive grid layout management.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

✅ Responsive and resizable window

✅ Grid layout that expands dynamically

✅ Clear (C) button to reset input

✅ Exit button to close application

✅ Error handling for invalid expressions

✅ Clean and user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (Built-in Python GUI library)

No external libraries required.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Calculator_Project.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd Calculator_Project

Run the program:

python calculator.py

The calculator window will open.

## 🧠 How It Works

The interface is built using tkinter.Tk()

Buttons are created dynamically using loops

The grid layout uses grid_rowconfigure() and grid_columnconfigure() for resizing

Expressions are evaluated using Python’s eval() function

Error handling prevents crashes on invalid input

## 📸 Preview

Resizable window with:

Numeric keypad

Arithmetic operators

Clear and Exit controls

Bold, readable display

## ⚠️ Note

This project uses Python’s eval() function to calculate expressions.
For production-level applications, a safer parser method is recommended.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, you practice:

GUI application development

Event-driven programming

Grid layout management

Basic error handling

Clean code structuring

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

Add keyboard support

Add scientific calculator functions

Add theme switch (Dark/Light mode)

Add history panel

Replace eval() with a safer expression parser
